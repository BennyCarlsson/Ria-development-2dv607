# Final Thoughts
It's done, it's finally over!

Joke aside. Before the course started I already heard good things about so my expectations where high. And I was not disappointed the course was really fun and I learned a lot of new things in a different way than other courses.

In my first blog post I wrote that I didn't like Javascript and I still don't :P BUT this course have opened my eyes to the awesome things that can be accomplished with Javascript and those things are amazing! Totally worth the pain of a burning hell that programming in Javascript gives you. I realized how awesome real-time web is and I can't believe in 2016 we still refresh pages to update content. That's totally so 2005! I love how the course tackles a new fresh library as react, for the first time since I started studying I feel up to date with the internet. I already started to look into different kind of Javascript libraries and frameworks and I will probably continue developing in Javascript since react opened my eyes for all the possibilities.

Nothing is perfect, and the same rule applies to this course. Even tough overall I enjoyed the course I thought the first weeks were really hard and I would have liked some more tutorials or assignments. I kinda got thrown into it and trying to learn react, redux and react router at the same time got me really confused and all mixed up. Some assignments to slowly introduce you to one thing at the time would have helped a lot.

But I loved how free we where in this course. Being able to choose your own project and getting credits for everything you do and actually having a teacher that cared and wanted to se what you have created was a lot of fun. I'm happy with the application I created even though the third part mobile app I use to ping my server is a little buggy!
