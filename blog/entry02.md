## Week 2 and I have yet **not** fallen in love with Javascript.
##### Javascript still doesn't make any sense to me and I'm having alot of trouble trying to understand everything with React, Redux and React Router. After trying to understand everything and getting overwhelmed with new information I realized that I have to break it down. I went to reacts website https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html and I went through the code line to line making sure I understood it.
##### I mostly played around with other peoples code and I don't have much to show, I also installed atom as my editor of choice. I might do a blog post about the 3 easiest way to write hello world in react! :P Just to contribute with something.
