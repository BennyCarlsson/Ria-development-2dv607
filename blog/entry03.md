# Entry 3
Well what can I say, atleast this week react is starting to make sence (does not mean I like it yet) and I finnally got everything up and runnig the way I want it. After many hours I successfully installed grunt and watchify so things can update directly on save and I don't have to type npm run build everytime I make a change in my code. I'm also starting to understand how package.json works..

Also spent waaaay to many hours on trying to get error highlightning in atom to work.. I just had to install jshint and in settings set it to support JSX...

## The amazing results
So what have i created this week? Well if I press my button it renders "Hellow World"..
